Using keyboard interfacing with STM32--A matrix keypad can be interfaced to the discovery board.
Then,an infinite while loop can be used to scan for a key press.When a keypress is detected,the digit entered can be identified using the combination of row and column number.
Once the digit is identified,the same logic used in question 3 can be implemented here as well.

Other sensors that can be used are push button switches connected to I/O pins.A number can be input as its binary equivalent using these switches.
The number can be obtained by reading the input pins.Thereafter,it can be tested to see if it is even or odd.
