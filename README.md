arm assignment set 2--assembly language

1. Implement Fibonacci  series using Cortex M4

2. Given three number find the largest of the three using Cortex M4

3.  Given a number find out whether it is even or ODD in Cortex M4

4. Can we do nested IF-Then else in CORTEX –M4 ?

Try it out on your simulator ….

5.  On you Hardware board STMF32  find out how you can input a number either through key board or through some kind of sensor and decide whether that is even or ODD

6. Here is C program to find GCD of two numbers, Re-Write this for CORTEX –M4

while (a != b)

 {

    if (a > b)

            a = a – b;

       else

            b = b – a;

}
