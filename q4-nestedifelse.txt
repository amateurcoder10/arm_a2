A nested-if-else cannot be directly implemented using the IT block instruction.

However,using slight changes in logic a nested if-then-else can be indirectly implemented on Cortex M4.
For example,

		CMP a,b
		BGT left
		BLE right

		left
		;further conditional braching

		right
		;further conditional branching
		
Conditional branches can be used to obtain the same results that a traditional nested-if-else blcok would give.
